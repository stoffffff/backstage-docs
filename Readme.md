These docs are for curious Platform or DevOps engineers who are willing to either prepare for the CBA "Certified Backstage Associate" or just willing to discover this amazing tool.<br>
###### Please refer to the official Backstage Docs if you're willing to, here ➡️ ***https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage***<br>

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
### Please note that these docs are 100% handmade by me, which means:<br> 
- Every screenshot is made from my local Backstage instance (UI), and every screenshot piece of code can be found at my backstage's instance repo, here ➡️ ***https://github.com/stoffffff/backstage*** | So don't worry if my screenshots are different from the one you find in the official Backstage's docs.
- This is not a copy-pasta type of docs, I use GenAI occasionnaly only for speed, meaning I use it only if I exactly know what I need and I control every line of code it gives me, then I test and verify it before I type every git push command. 😄 So be easy on me if you find a mistake somewhere...<br>
- This also means that some mistakes can be found in the docs, whereas at the code, they are pretty rare or trivial since every added piece of code is tested before I start screening the steps and uploading them, also Backstage would throw some errors if something breaks. So as long as I uploaded screenshots showcasing steps and verifications, the code is safe and error-free.<br>
- If you find a mistake, please raise a pull request. 😄<br>
- Finally, enjoy !<br>
